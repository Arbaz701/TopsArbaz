    <h2>Absolute Path</h2> 
    <h3>An absolute path makes no assumptions about your current location in relation to the location of the file or directory it's describing. An absolute path always begins from the absolute start of your hard drive and describes every step you must take through the filesystem to end up at the target location.<h3>
    <p>Exact location</p>
    <p>Exact location of loaded file from executed file</p>

    <h2>Relative Path</h2>
    <h3>A relative path describes the location of a file relative to the current (working) directory*. An absolute path describes the location from the root directory. When learning to access data files through programming, we regularly use relative file paths.</h3>
